sand rains down and here I sit
holding rare flowers in a tomb
in bloom
down in a hole and I don't know if I can be saved
see my heart i decorated it like a grave 
you don't undestard who they tought I was supposed to be
I'd like to fly
but my wings have been so denied 

i've eaten the sun so my tongue has been burned of the taste
I will speak no more of my feelings beneath
down in a hole 
losing my soul
